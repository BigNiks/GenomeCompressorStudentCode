| November 12 |  4-5pm   |                                                                                                                                               I first worked on expand and layed out a simple groundwork for now, not really worrying about space yet. I did the same for expand. |
| November 14 | 3-3:30pm |                                                                                                                  I edited my compress code to use a map for the 4 specific characters used in genomeTest. I then used that map to write out the binary version of each character. |
| November 14 |  6-7pm   | Kind of similar to compress, I created another map for my characters, this time I had the values stored in binary codes so that I could easily input the binary value of the current character I was looking at into my map in order to see which character it corresponded with. |
